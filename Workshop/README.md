# Block 21 Workshop: Party Planner

Your friend is an event organizer and has asked you to build a website for them. They want to be able to keep track of all the parties they are organizing. They want to be able to see a list of all the parties, add new parties, and delete parties.

## Requirements

Build your website according to this user story:

> A user enters the website and finds a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all the parties that are happening.
> Next to each party in the list is a delete button. The user clicks the delete button for one of the parties. That party is then removed from the list.
> There is also a form that allows the user to enter information about a new party that they want to schedule. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user observes their party added to the list of parties.

## Getting Started

There is no starter code for this workshop; the solutions to previous activities will be great to review!

1. Create a new repository named Unit2.PartyPlanner on GitHub and clone it down.
2. Add your cohort team to the repository you just made.
3. Read the [API documentation](https://fsa-crud-2aa9294fe819.herokuapp.com/api/). You will be working with the /events endpoint.
4. Plan your code based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.
